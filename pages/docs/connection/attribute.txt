====== Connection - Variables ======


===== Attribute =====
A ''connection variable'' is a property of a [[connection|connection]] that:
  * define how to connect to a [[docs:system:system|system connection]] via its [[uri|URL attribute]] 
  * and configure the behavior of this connection.

===== Type =====
==== Mandatory ====

The only mandatory variables are:
  * the [[name|connection name]]
  * and the [[uri|URL]]

==== Built-in Attribute ====
Built-in attributes modify the behavior ''Tabulify''. See [[built_in_attribute]]


===== Management =====

==== See ====
You can see the ''variable'' of your connection with the [[docs:tabli:connection:info|connection info command]].

==== Set ====

You can set the ''variable'' of your connection:
  * by editing manually the [[..:conf:vault|connection vault]]
  * or with the [[docs:tabli:connection:upsert|connection upsert command]].


===== Configuration =====
==== Automatic Encryption ====
The ''encrypted-variables'' [[docs:conf:conf|configuration]] lists the ''attributes'' where the value should be automatically [[docs:common:vault|encrypted]].

Example, the [[docs:tabli:variable:set|variable set command]] will encrypt the connection ''user'' and [[uri|uri]] [[docs:conf:variable|variable]] ''value'' 
<code bash>
tabli variable set encrypted-variables user,uri
</code>

<note important>
The [[password|password]] attribute when present is always encrypted
