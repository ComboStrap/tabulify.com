====== Project - environment ======


===== About =====
An ''environment'' is a string that permits to select the configurations from a [[docs:project:project-file|project file]].


===== Built-in =====

Tabulify knows the following environment by default:

^ Name ^ default ^ Prod Status ^ Description ^
| ''fqdn'' | yes | no | The host name (the fully qualified name of the machine) |
| ''development'' | yes (if fqdn is not found) | no | A common development environment |
| ''production'' | | yes | The production environment |



<note>
[[:docs:op:op|operations]] may react differently depending on it.

To avoid sending emails in a non-production environment, the [[docs:op:sendmail|send operation]] will send them all
to the ''to'' address of the smtp connection.
</note>

===== How to set the environment ? =====

You can set the environment :
  * at the command line with the ''--env'' option of tabli.
<code bash>
tabli --env development
</code>
  * via a [[docs:conf:os|tabli os environment variable]]
<code bash>
TABLI_ENV=development
</code>

===== How to see the environment =====

With the ''project.env'' internal variable.

Example:
<code bash>
tabli variable list project.env
</code>
