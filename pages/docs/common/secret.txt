''Secret'' are a piece of information that you don't want to be visible in clear in your code.

The most known secret are tokens that represents a credential in order to log in to a [[docs:system:system|system]]:
  * [[docs:connection:password]]
  * api key
  * ...
To enhance secrecy you may also want to cache other information such as the location of you system (host, port,...)

To make a secret available to ''Tabulify'', you can:
  * encrypt it via the [[vault|vault functionality]]
  * or set it as:
      * an argument of the command line 
      * or an environment variable
