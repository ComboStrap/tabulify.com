====== Tabulify - Passphrase ======


===== Passphrase =====
To [[vault|encrypt and decrypt]] [[secret|secret attributes]], ''Tabulify'' uses a ''passphrase''. 


This ''passphrase'' is used to generate a cryptographic key for the [[vault|encryption]].

===== Tabli =====
In [[docs:tabli:tabli|Tabli]], the ''passphrase'' can be given with the ''%%--passphrase%%'' [[docs:tabli:global|global option]].

===== Security Consideration =====

According to the [[wp>Kerckhoffs%27_principle|Kerckhoffs' principle]] ''only secrecy of the key provides security'', you should take great care of your ''passphrase''

==== Developement ====

In an development environment, a ''passphrase'' could be shared broadly because the data should have no secrecy character. 

==== Production ====

In an production environment, the ''passphrase'' should be manipulated with care and be kept private.

You can achieve with several methods. We give two methods below.
=== Wrapper script ===
A ''wrapper script'' is a script that wraps the command with the following permissions:
  * executable
  * no read (can't be read)

The script can be executed but cannot be read by the user.

Example:
<code bash tabliWrapper.sh>
tabli --passphrase secret "$@"
</code>


=== Credentials Vault ===

If your environment has a credential vault functionality with SSO, you could retrieve it programmatically based on the credentials of the logged user.
