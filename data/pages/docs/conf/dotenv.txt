====== Dotenv variable file ======


===== About =====
The ''dotenv variable file'' is a [[docs:conf:variable_file|variable file]] where you can add secret variables that should not be in your source version control system.


===== Name and location =====

The ''dotenv'' file name has the following name structure:

<code>
.env[.name]
</code>
where:
  * ''name'' is the [[:docs:project:environment|environment name]].

If the name is:
  * not present, the env file is always taken
  * present, the env file is taken only for the corresponding environment

The searched location is:
  * the [[:docs:project:project|project home]]
  * otherwise the working directory (where you execute the tabli command line)

===== Git =====

This file is generally added into your [[https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore|.gitignore]] file. 
This way, it's never committed into your repository version control system and stays local on your computer.

Example:
<code txt .gitignore>
.env
</code>

===== Example =====

Below are variables used to connect to the planete scale database. 
<code ini .env>
PLANETSCALE_URL=jdbc:mysql://xxxxx.us-east-4.psdb.cloud/test?sslMode=VERIFY_IDENTITY
PLANETSCALE_USER=theSecretUser
PLANETSCALE_PWD=theSecretPassword
</code>

<note tip>
You can then use them as [[template|template variables]] in a [[:docs:conf:vault|connection vault]].
