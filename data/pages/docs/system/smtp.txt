<panel>
<label>Connection Vault</label>
In a [[docs:conf:vault|Connection Vault]], to define a smtp [[docs:connection:connection|connection]] with the name ''mySmtp'', you could write:
\\

<code properties>
[mySmtp]
uri = smtp://localhost:587
user = user
pwd = secret
to = foo@tabulify.com; bar@tabulify.com
to-names = foo; bar
from = tabulify@server.com
from-name = tabulify
tls = true
auth = true
</code>

</panel>
<panel selected>
<label>Tabli</label>

With the [[docs:tabli:connection:add|tabli add command of the connection module]], adding a smtp connection with the name ''smtpConnectionName'':

<code dos>
tabli connection add "smtpConnectionName" "smtp://localhost:587"
</code>

Note that you can add all configuration as query properties of the uri.
